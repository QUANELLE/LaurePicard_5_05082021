## MON README FRONT
Project 5 for OpenClassRooms Web Developer course. 
My Frontend files are in the "public" folder. 
The backend, the specifics of which are described below, is accessible at the following address:http://localhost:3000/api/teddies.

### Prerequisites ###

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Installation ###

Clone this repo. From within the project folder, run `npm install`. You 
can then run the server with `node server`. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
